As for the price, there are various rumours flying around. According to Tom's Guide, the entry level iPhone 12 could start at the same $699 price as the current iPhone 11, while some leakers have even suggested the Mini version could enjoy a slight price reduction, starting at $699. But at the other end of the scale, others suggest that if the phones are capable of 5G, there could even be a price hike, with the cheapest iPhone 12 coming in at $750. In short, nobody can be sure. But with this being Apple, no version of the iPhone 12 is likely to come cheap.

While it was disappointing not to see the iPhone 12 during Apple's 'Time Flies' event this month, it seems we haven't got long to wait. And with any luck, the company might even have a "one more thing" up its sleeve (the resurrection of AirPower, perhaps?). But in this strangest of years, nothing is guaranteed â€“ not least Apple's usually steadfast release cycle. If you want to get your hands on a brilliant iPhone today, check out the best deals below.
