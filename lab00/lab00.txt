1. I am taking this class because it is required. However, I am really excited to further my knowledge of computer science
   and be challenged in this course. I also know that this course will help me in technical interviews and will have real world
   applications.

2. It is never acceptable to allow someone else to have your work for
   reference or to refer to someone else’s work while writing your own.
   
   Cheating requires an “F” course grade.

3. I agree.
